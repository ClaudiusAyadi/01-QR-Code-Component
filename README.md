## Overview

The QR Code Component challenge is a beginner-friendly project and the first challenge recommended to me when I joined Frontend Mentor.

Simple as it is, it helps me re-evaluate my flexbox knowledge and the use of `box shadow` to create elevated-styled cards. It was a fast one filled with much fun too.

## My process

1. I downloaded the project and went through the `README.md` and `style guide`.
2. I went to create a directory for the new project inside the master repo.
3. Then laid out the component in HTML with appropriate classes based on the BEM.
4. style.css was next, where I designed the component and its parts using modern CSS properties.
5. I deleted the old `README.md` and updated the README.md template file to write down the process and other required information.
6. Added untracked files as I work, commit and push everything as needed.
7. Deployed to Netlify, updated the `README.md` with the project live URL, and submitted to Frontend Mentor.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use the `box-shadow` property in this project. It was the main game changer for the card to pop out as it is.

### Continued development

In the future, I'd love to use a `grid` instead of `flex` for the page layout and only use flexbox for the component items.

`` EDIT: I finally used `grid` for the page layout and `place-items: center` property. However, there's a new issue I'd like to solve. I want the footer to sit at the bottom of the screen. Is there a way I can place the item at the bottom of the grid? ``

I hope to master the grid and flexbox properties with some CSS animations. Down the road, I'm looking at having enough card components that I can use for different occassions.
